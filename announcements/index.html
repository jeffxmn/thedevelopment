      <h2>Introducing The Development 2.0</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since we launched in December, we've been thinking about how we could make the experience of reading website interviews even better. We knew v1.0 wouldn't last very long, and in the last month, we've tried to rethink a lot of things, bringing four major changes to the way The Development works.
      </p>
      <h4>Change #1 - A New Design</h4>
      <p>
        We liked the sidebar-based v1.0 (and still do!): it was a great way to put the day's current interview up front, while keeping a list of past interviews visible for new readers to browse through. But as time went on, we yearned for the type of clean, "content-focused" look that many content-consumption sites like Medium, Minimally Minimal, and The Great Discontent, had. As we were inspired by The Setup for v1.0, we drew the same inspiration from those three websites (and others similar) in v2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new design removes the sidebar, and centres the content in a full-width page. Each interview's website screenshot is larger, and is the first thing you'll see. The rest of the interview follows right under. Something new at the bottom of each interview are social buttons that we hope will drive more sharing, and below that, is a section dedicated to navigate to the next and previous interviews.
      </p>
      <h4>Change #2 - Bi-weekly to Weekly interviews</h4>
      <p>
        Monday + Wednesday interviews were great. Once at the start of the week, and another at the middle to keep things going. But a mistake we've been wanting to fix since launch was that Monday interviews had only two days of being featured, while Wednesday interviews had five. While it wasn't initially a concern of ours since recent interviews were easily accessible because of the persistent sidebar, we wanted to make things more balanced and fair for all interviewers as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for every interview to have the same amount of featured days every week, we decided to switch to a once-a-week system.
      </p>
      <h4>Change #3 - More flexible interviews</h4>
      <p>
        We're taking a new approach to each interview in an attempt to make them more "personal" to each interviewee. Starting late March to April, you'll see *additional* questions that are more specific to the developer or designer we're interviewing. Whether it's about a specific image or style in their website, or a philosophy they seem to carry, we'll be giving readers more contextual answers to read.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        And even better, doing so, let's us start interviewing non-personal/portfolio websites as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting today, we're going to be expanding interviews to not only personal portfolio websites, but also project- and blog- type websites. In addition to amazing personal portfolios, you'll start to see different types of websites as part of the mix of the many interviews coming up.
      </p>
      <h4>We're just getting started</h4>
      <p>
        As always, we're open to all sorts of feedback and are always looking for ways to make The Development better, so let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/_thedevelopment">Twitter</a>. And while you're there, don't hesitate to follow us and keep up with new and exciting interviews every Monday!
