    <h2>About the site</h2>
    <p>
      The Development is a website and blog dedicated to sharing stories about people and their websites, in interview form as inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>.
    </p>

  <div id="interviews" class="about-section">
    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      To keep things interesting and refrain from abundant amounts of interviews, new interviews will be posted twice a week on
      <span class="bold">Mondays</span> and <span class="bold">Wednesdays</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to get yourself interviewed on the website, it's easy! Email us at <a href="mailto:thedevelopment.interviews@gmail.com">thedevelopment.interviews@gmail.com</a>
      with your (carefully edited and spellchecked!) answers to these questions:
        <ol id="interview-questions">
          <li>Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.</li>
          <li>Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?</li>
          <li>What part of your website is your favourite, and why?</li>
          <li>Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?</li>
          <li>Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries? * [Optional]</li>
          <li>Any upcoming changes we should look out for?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd also need some meta information:
        <ol id="meta-info">
          <li>Your Website URL, of course!</li>
          <li>A position or identifier you want to use (like, "Web developer in Toronto")</li>
          <li>Your Twitter handle, or if you don't use Twitter, any other social network you'd like to show (or none if you prefer)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for the interviews, so it would be great if you used it too :). Otherwise, plain text is just fine.

    <h2>So what did YOU use to build this website?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, curious creature, this site is actually <a href="https://github.com/jeffxmn/thedevelopment">open sourced on GitHub</a>,
      where it's also <a href="http://pages.github.com">hosted</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      It's built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, with a heavily modified "theme", using no more than the usual HTML/CSS (no preprocessors) and minimal JavaScript.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="team" class="about-section">
    <h2>Wait, who's "you"?</h2>
    <p>
      We are <a href="http://jeffreymartin.ca">Jeff Martin</a> and <a href="http://victormakcy.com">Victor Mak</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Jeff codes, designs, and manages things here. Victor reaches out to people to be interviewed, and also helps manage things.
