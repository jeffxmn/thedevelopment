    <h3>About the site</h3>
    <p>
      The Development is a simple blog dedicated to sharing stories about people and their websites in interview form.<br />
      This website started with my curiosity about other people's websites.
      I spent a lot of time exploring other personal websites, wanting to know about the design, the libraries they used, and anything and everything else.
      One day, with inspiration from <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>, I thought it would be cool to build something similar, albeit centred around people's websites.

    <h3>Interviews</h3>
    <p>
      Since this website is fresh and new, I'll be spending a lot of my time reaching out to people asking if they want to be interviewed.
      To keep things interesting and refrain from abundant amounts of interviews, I'll post new interviews (if there are any available) twice a week on
      Mondays and Wednesdays.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to get yourself interviewed on the website, it's easy! Email me at <a href="mailto:thedevelopment.interviews@gmail.com">thedevelopment.interviews@gmail.com</a>
      with your (carefully edited and spellchecked) answers to these questions:
        <ol id="interview-questions">
          <li>Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.</li>
          <li>Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?</li>
          <li>What part of your website is your favourite, and why?</li>
          <li>Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?</li>
          <li>Any upcoming changes we should look out for?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      I use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for the interviews, so it would be great (but not mandatory) if you used it too :).

    <h3>So what did YOU use to build this website?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, curious creature, this site is actually <a href="https://github.com/jeffxmn/thedevelopment">open sourced on GitHub</a>,
      where it's also <a href="http://pages.github.com">hosted</a>! It's built using the Jekyll static site generator, with a heavily modified "theme" of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fancy, I'm open to contributions of any sort to the website. If you want a feature request, gladly open an issue. If you find and want
      to fix a bug, go ahead an open a pull request. In fact, if you want to submit posts directly without going through the email part, you can also
      do that through a pull request with a .md file to the _posts directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't (yet) have any guidelines to contributions, but all I ask is that you keep your code clean, and your posts carefully edited.
