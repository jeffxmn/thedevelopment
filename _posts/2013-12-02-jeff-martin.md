**Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.**

I'm a frontend web developer and designer who likes to take up projects and create the most random things (like this website). I spent my education years studying OOP languages like Java, but nowadays I like to focus on web development, UI design, and sometimes, mobile development. I find it super fun to work on the bleeding edge of software development and design. I love open source, so naturally, I'm a heavy user of [GitHub](http://github.com/jeffxmn). I also often use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffxmn), and sometimes write stuff on [Medium](http://medium.com/@jeffxmn). 

When I'm not coding, I take pictures and post them on my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/jeffxmn), [VSCO Grid](http://jeffxmn.vsco.co), or [500px](http://500px.com/jeffxmn) accounts. Ironically, I think I'm terrible at doing interviews. I never know what to say and how to say it. You have no idea how long it took to write this one.

**Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?**

I'm a huge fan of minimal design. I built my website a little over a year ago, and since then, I've revamped it (aka rewrote everything from scratch) at least eight times. I work on my website until I'm perfectly happy with it, only to become unhappy with it a few weeks later, and revamp it again. I've played around with JQuery animations, CSS animations, one-page layouts, and currently, timelines. Feel free to check my [website](http://jeffreymartin.ca) again in a few weeks to see whether or not I've become unhappy with it.

**What part of your website is your favourite, and why?**

The animations! The fade-in-from-left animations are thanks to an excellent library by [Dan Eden](http://daneden.me). I've been wanting to do something similar for a while, but I couldn't get started (for obvious reasons of procrastination). Luckily, I stumbled into Dan Eden's library on a [Medium post](https://medium.com/design-ux/799d16952a56) (by a writer named Dan too... whoa), and when I saw he open sourced the code on [Github](http://github.com/daneden/animate.css), I instantly fell head over heels for it. I forked it in hopes to contribute to it, and you should too!

**Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?**

I like to keep my website light on resources whenever possible. Right now, I'm using:

  - A modified, lighter, Bootstrap 3 (for the grid system)
  - animate.css (for the animations)

I used JQuery in past versions of my website, but as of this version, I'm not (!). Let's see how long _that_ lasts.

**Any upcoming changes we should look out for?**

More minimalism. I already have frequent thoughts, dreams, and nightmares, about what I would like the next revision to look like. At this rate, it's just a matter of time when I'll break down, open Coda 2, and do a CMD+A, delete.
