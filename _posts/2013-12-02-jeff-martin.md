## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

I'm a web and mobile developer who likes to take up projects and create the most random things (like this website). I spent my education years studying OOP languages like Java, but in recent years I've tended to focus on web development, UI design, and, mobile development. I find it super fun to work on the bleeding edge of software development and design, and I love open source, so naturally, I'm a heavy user of [GitHub](http://github.com/jffrymrtn). I also often use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jffrymrtn), and sometimes write stuff on [Medium](http://medium.com/@jffrymrtn) or on my [blog](http://jeffreymartin.ca/blog/).

When I'm not coding, I take pictures and post them on my [500px](http://500px.com/jeffxmn) account. Ironically, I think I'm terrible at doing interviews. I never know what to say and how to say it. You have no idea how long it took to write this one.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

I'm a huge fan of minimalism. I built my website a little over a year ago, and since then, I've revamped it (aka rewrote everything from scratch) at least nine times. I work on my website until I'm perfectly happy with it, only to become unhappy with it a few weeks later, and revamp it again. I've played around with JQuery animations, CSS animations, one-page layouts, timelines, and currently, Jekyll. Feel free to check my [website](http://jeffreymartin.ca) again in a few weeks to see whether or not I've become unhappy with it.

In this first revision of 2014, I've gone with spacious design and use of one of my favourite colours throughout the site. It's also the first of my websites to have its own [blog](http://jeffreymartin.ca/blog/). I figured, it's a core functionality and purpose of Jekyll to include a blog, so why not? In many ways more than one, I hope this iteration of my website motivates me to write more (and better).

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

I think this recent change (as of February 2014) is my favourite so far. I'm a huge fan of light blue, and I've been wanting to make my website in hues of blue for a long time. Every time, I'd get feedback that the hue I used was too blinding or bright. I think I have a good balance now (at least from my POV), and it's a live testament to my strong belief that part of realizing your artistic vision is to be bold and different.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

I like to keep my website light on resources whenever possible. Right now, I'm using:

  - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
  - [animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) (for the animations on my home and project pages)

The majority of the work is in the CSS (thanks to Jekyll's awesome handling of page layouts. I host everything on GitHub Pages, which I love since it helps keep my GitHub Contributions Graph active (muahahaha).

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

A better way of displaying my projects and work. And maybe more colour. Light blue isn't the only colour I like to use, so don't be surprised if other colours pop up in different pages. Since I also like to revamp my website so often, I hope to someday incorporate an archive of all of my past websites. I'm sure one day, it'll be fun for myself to go through and question why I ever did what I did.
