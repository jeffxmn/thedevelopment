## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

My name is Bonnie Li and I am currently completing my third co-op term at [Pixlee](http://pixlee.com) in San Francisco. I will be entering my 3A term as a Mathematical Studies student at The University of Waterloo in January.

In the past I had an interest in web development and focused heavily on front-end development. I have recently changed my focus towards back-end development, as I am still trying out different parts of the industry. I'm still learning every single day and hope to gain more experience with every single opportunity!

I find it difficult to find words that describe me, so I'll just end it here :)

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

My website is used for my co-op job hunting seasons to showcase my skills/experience and of course a place where employers can contact me easily! I revamp my website around every 8 months, so the design is always refreshing!

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

One thing not everyone would notice just by taking a look at my website, is that almost everything is based off the golden ratio!

My friend Joe Mercer, recently came out with a stylesheet with a group of classes based on the golden ratio. Since I studied the golden ratio during high school in a course called Art of Math (very interesting course), I was very excited about this plugin to my website and was very happy with the results!

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

Itâ€™s a bit difficult to answer this question because every revamp is a dramatic change. I normally start from scratch, rarely is anything the same as before and the new design would be based on what I wanted at that time.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

LESS, [Golden](https://github.com/joemercer/golden), jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

Like I said, I revamp my website pretty often, but I hope to launch more sections to my website such as a blog or side projects opened to the public!
