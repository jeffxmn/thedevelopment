## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

My name is Roman. I was born and grew up in Ukraine. Now I'm 22 years old. When I was 16 I got interested in web design and eventually it became my hobby. In 2008 I entered [university](http://eenu.edu.ua/en) and my specialization was Computer Science. Being a student, I started working as a freelancer in a web design area and this was a turning point in my whole life. In 2012 I graduated from university and received Bachelor's degree, in 2013 - Master's degree. I'm still a full-time freelancer and I do my best to learn new things in this area. Besides design I'm interested in cosmos, science fiction, traveling. I enjoy to have hot coffee in the morning, clean & neat interfaces in the afternoon and my dear wife in the evening.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

Like all designers I always wanted to create an interesting website portfolio for my works, but as you know "the cobbler's wife is the worst shod". Each time I started creating my own website, I eventually was disappointed in the idea and started all over again. After graduation I had a lot of extra free time and I decided to devote it to design of my own website. I was inspired by [Blueprint Split Layout](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/SplitLayout) idea and decided to move in this direction. A lot of splendid websites on [awwwards.com](http://www.awwwards.com) also inspired me and gradually I achieved my own result.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

It's hard to identify a separate part of the website, that's why I believe that website is a unified and comprehensive solution addressing the goal. However, if talking about the details of the interface, I definitely select the first screen, which is submitted in a form of split layout with hover animation. I think that this detail makes my website original and unforgettable.

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

During the work on my website I increased my skills in animation development. If I had known all that things before I started the work, I wouldn't have waste so much time on it. But I can't say that I regret it, because every work brings me new and very important experience as well as new knowledge.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

During the work on my website, I used these technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript, Jquery Framework
- Google Web Fonts
- and my favourite Eclipse IDE

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

Of course, I'll be adding new works to my portfolio. Besides, I want to add a list of awards and mentions about me in blogs :)
