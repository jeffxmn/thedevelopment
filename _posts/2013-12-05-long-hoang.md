## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

My name is Long (yes, it literally is). I'm a web developer, artist, blogger, and occasional foosball player. While you're there, you can check out my poorly-maintained [blog](http://longhoang.ca/blog).

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

I just wanted to create a website that showcased all my projects like a portfolio but with things that I found interesting and cool. My original wordpress site was getting quite dated so I decided to give it a fresh overhaul once bootstrap 3 was officially released. I wanted to incorporate flat and responsive design so the tools available allowed me to lay the foundation quite rapidly.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

Probably the Projects section. Just being able to view all my past work and realizing how much I've improved with every project I've worked on. It's like a trip down memory lane.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

Just the latest version of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and a few JQuery plugins. I wanted to keep it simple.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

I plan to embed some videos in the background and may add a few more sections that I find relevant. It's always a work-in-progress.
