## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

Hi! I'm Charlie Clark - an interactive developer based in Brooklyn, currently working at [Domani Studios](http://domanistudios.com). I graduated from Parsons in 2012 with a BFA in Graphic Design, but by my senior year I was working almost exclusively on interactive digital projects. Fresh out of school, I started as a web developer intern at [Stinkdigital](http://stinkdigital.com), where I went on to work as a  lead developer on a number of award winning projects.

I love writing clever code, experimenting with new web technologies, and challenging myself to make things that are both solidly built and innovative. In my spare time, I love to create more artful personal stuff, like my latest project ["The Colors of Twitter"](http://thecolorsoftwitter.com) - an interactive data visualization of the use of color on twitter.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

I built a very simple website when I was applying for jobs at the end of school, but after working for a year and learning a bunch of new things, I wanted to have a portfolio site that reflected what I knew. I come from a Flash background, and I love doing cool visual things in Canvas. I came up with the idea for this crazy color-changing pixelated graphic, and decided to use that as a starting point for the rest of my site.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

I love my splash page. Some people hate it, and I've heard the term "epileptic seizure inducing" thrown around a couple times to describe it, but I like the fact that its startling and unusual.

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

When I first built the site, I built it all using Handlebars - a client side templating library. I later went back and changed all the templating to happen server-side in PHP, which sped up the rendering of the site and made it more SEO friendly.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

HTML5 Canvas for my splash page, Raphael SVG for my icons and the color-changing image in the about section, Tweenlite for smoother animation. I also use Grunt to compile my LESS and minify my javascript.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

I'll be adding a bunch of new projects that I'm finishing up right now, so check back often :)
