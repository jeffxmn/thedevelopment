## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

I'm Alee Foroughi, creative director and designer at Swan Design Studio. I was born in Tehran located in the beautiful country, Iran. I've been designing since 2008. At the begining  I was a freelance graphic designer and I designed Logos, Posters, Brochures, Food Packages. I designed for more than ten brands in only first three years. Gradually I decided to design websites in order to develope my career. After that I designed three websites with Flash but it wasn't as efficient as I expected. So I started to study HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript in order to develope my skills and increase the usability and functionality of websites.

I founded Swan Design Studio in 2012 to have  projects done properly. I've designed and developed more than 12 websites for different brands. all available in my [portfolio website](http://aleeforoughi.com/).

I always try to think differently in order to represent works different to others. For this reason I've won more than 25 design awards and prizes in last 2 years.

## Is there a story behind your site or reasoning behind designing it the way it is?

Actually, I needed a website to introduce my self to show who I am and what I think furthermore my portfolio to customers. I'm a designer but Before designing this website I didn't have even a personal website. As I'm working at Swan it's hard to make any free time to spend on personal affairs.

## There are some great scolling parallax effects, do you feel like they helped in emphasizing the photos more as people scroll through them?

Certainly. One of the most considerable parts of a website are photos. Parallax effects make them more impressive for users. I have used parallax effects in my other works specially for food industries websites which they need to advertise their products. [Ronik Food Industies website](http://ronikco.com/) and [Badr Food Industries webkit](http://badrfood.com/) might be good examples of what I have done.

## You mention "Great Design is Transparent", could you elaborate on what you mean?

You must have heard: "Good design is obvious, Great design is transparent." It's a quote from one of the most famous designers, Joe Sparano.
I came across this quote long time ago and I have had it in the back of my mind pondering its meaning. I have come to a conclusion that, this quote means; Good design is obvious, it has accountability, and great design is transparent because it functions in a manner not evident to the user whereas by contrast bad design has no accountability nor does it function well.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

Since it's my personal website, Naturally I like all parts of the website. But the part which indicates my works with triangle masks might be my favourite part. I used SVG to mask the HTML sections and the background image is fixed when you are scrolling. I inferred it from reflect of things in the mirror. It makes you feel you have some triangle mirrors which are set with different rotations. That's why it's a special part for me.

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

Yes. I suppose it happens normally. In my point of view you are promoting your skills during each projects which you do. That's why I believe as you have each project done, it seems I have brushed up my information and I'm geable and more experienced than before and I wish I could start the project again to design.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

Certainly. I have to design a part to show more details about my works. Also it would be better to add a part as a blog for my daily notes. Furthermore I have to make it responsive to browse the website in all devices.
