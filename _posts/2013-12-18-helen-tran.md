## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

Hello! I'm a Product Designer and I work at [Shopify](http://shopify.com).

I've been creating and moving things around on the internet for about twelve years now. I love change so the speed of the industry was a good match for me.

Fun facts about me: I'm afraid of strong winds, have a pretty intense wanderlust, and I spend a lot of my time in comedy clubs.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

It was a very slow process to conceptualize the site as it stands now. It took me many years and many redesigns to understand how I wanted to represent myself online.

I was constantly stuck in the production stage and I always thought it because I didn't have my own style. I realized, quite recently actually, that conceptually it was weak and I needed to go back to the basics before I jumped into production. My website didn't align to my values as a Designer.

I've always felt that typical portfolios are insufficient at representing individuals holistically. What makes a great Designer to me is much more complex than  work samples and I wanted my website to represent that. A timeline and collective was more suitable to what I was trying to do and I find it conceptually satisfying (for the time-being.)

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

I am quite happy with the inspiration posts that I have. They give a little insight into me, and if anything, they're useful when I'm feeling creatively blocked.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

JQuery is used for the filters/animations, SCSS for CSS pre-processing and Jekyll and Liquid generate my website files.

I also use Github for version control and people can see my full [source code](https://github.com/tranhelen/helentran) should they decide they're interested.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

I've never had the luxury of a good foundation to build upon so in terms of redesigning/restyling that most likely won't happen for awhile. For now, just new content on a regular basis.
