## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

My name is Xenia Tay, and I study Computer Science and minor in Fine Arts at the University of Waterloo.

I was born and grew up in Singapore, halfway across the globe from my current location. In 2010, I moved to Canada and haven't stopped moving since. My love for exploring cities has led me to co-op terms in Toronto, Austin (Texas), Vancouver and next up: California. I've had a variety of co-op jobs, all related to design and front-end development, and absolutely adored my jobs. I can safely say that working is my favourite part of school!

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

My website has always been a bit of a struggle: I revamp it every 6 months with a grand vision in mind, and it never quite hits the bar.

With the latest design however, I finally feel on the right track. In previous iterations, I always planned for fancy navigation, a portfolio gallery and even a blog for my potential words of wisdom. That never panned out because content shapes design, but I didn't have the foundation of strong content to hold up my grand design.

With that lesson in mind, I trimmed down my content, cut away the fluff, and focused only on what I can present about myself. Thus, this design was born: inspired by the latest trends in flat design, minimalism and of course, the Facebook timeline.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

My favourite part is that the site is responsive. Responsive development was something I really drilled into during my last co-op at [Indochino](http://www.indochino.com) and it was nice to bring that skill back and apply it to my own site. I even prefer the compact look of the mobile view to the widescreen view - small is cute!

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

Jekyll. Back when I first set up my site in 2011, it was a bunch of .html pages that weren't fun to deal with. I've come a long way since then, but migrating the site to use Jekyll is on the top of my to-do list.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

[LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/), CSS3, Photoshop (mockup), Illustrator (icons), [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).

I hoard design assets like icons and stock photos from [Creative Market](creativemarket.com) or use resources like [NounProject](http://thenounproject.com/). Having a wealth of design assets to pick from when starting a project is a huge time-saver - especially since I'm not a particularly good photographer. I also usually work with jQuery but this site didn't require any fancy Javascript.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

A new design! I've been working on my current baby ([http://2014.cusec.net](http://2014.cusec.net/)) and it's been fairly inspiring. Once I've wrapped up with that, I'll be coming back and working in some of the new tricks I learnt. Keep an eye out :)
