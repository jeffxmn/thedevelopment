**Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.**

My name is Victor Mak, I’m a full-stack web developer with heavy focus on UI/UX design. I’m a 4th year student at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) and currently work as a software engineer for [SoapBox](http://soapboxhq.com), an innovation management tool based in Toronto. I like to think of myself as a true generalist with interest in various areas of web development, from making things look pretty on the front-end to dealing with databases and servers on the back-end.

I love working on random side projects and interacting with talented people in the design and development scene, as I am able to learn and incorporate their methodologies into my everyday work. Because of this I am a frequent user of [GitHub](http://github.com/victormakcy), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vicmakcy) and frequent viewer of various design and development blogs such as [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com), and [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com)

Aside from coding I have interest in many other things ranging from startups to photography ([500px](http://500px.com/victormakcy)) to finance, it’s just the generalist part about me.

**Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?**

**What part of your website is your favourite, and why?**

**Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?**

**Any upcoming changes we should look out for?**
