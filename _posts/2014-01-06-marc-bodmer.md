## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

I'm Marc Bodmer and I am a web developer with a focus on front-end development. I recently graduated from University of Guelph with a degree in Computer Science and am now working as a software developer for the best online photography community, [500px](http://500px.com).

I started working on Open Source projects while still in University and that introduced me to the world of web development. Since then, I have been working extensively with all kinds of tech stacks for the web. I love being challenged on creating software in a short amount of time and as a result enter myself into online programming contests and local hackathons. Furthermore, I enjoy attending tech conferences and local tech meetup groups in Toronto, and even speaking at them when I have an opportunity to do so. Check out some of the stuff I have been working on through my [Github profile](https://github.com/m-bodmer).

In my off time, I love to explore the world, rock climb in the summer and ski in the winter.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

My initial website was created in June 2012 as a portfolio for job interviews. It was a very simple one page slider that displayed my basic info and projects I was working on at the time. Over time, it evolved as a playground for various new web technologies and design principles I was coming across.

The most recent iteration still exists as a one page site describing myself and showcasing my projects. Nowadays, I use it as a reference for people I meet to find out more information about me and where to find me on various social networks.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

The giant Bokeh texture background image that exists as the landing image for my site. I am a sucker for large background images in web design, so I of course had to do the same for my website.

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

Keep the content simple. At first I was adding too much content, and it became a hassle trying to organize the content efficiently and make the site responsive.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

I kept it pretty simple technology wise with basic HTML, Javascript and CSS. However, I did find a bunch of useful jQuery plugins that saved me a bunch of time writing code:

  - [Sticky](https://github.com/garand/sticky): Make elements on your page always stay visible
  - [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/): Responsive lightboxes and dialogs
  - [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/): Full size dynamically resized background images

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

I am in the looking to define some personal branding (i.e. logo), create a new blog using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and add more side projects.
