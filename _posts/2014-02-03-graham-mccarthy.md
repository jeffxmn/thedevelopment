## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

I'm CTO and Co-Founder of a tech start-up in Toronto called [SoapBox Innovations](http://soapboxhq.com). We make an engaged innovation platform for enterprise clients to capture and screen ideas from their customers or workforce.

Previously, I worked at [Ryerson University](http://www.ryerson.ca/index.html), managing a team of developers working on some innovation technologies utilizing mobile apps, way-finding and content discovery. It was a lot of fun.

I received a Masters of Information from University of Toronto and a B.A from York University in Information Technology.

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

I am not a designer, so I've given up completely on trying to make my site look pretty. The goal of my website is to showcase some of the websites, games and music I've created over the years. More recently I've been writing code tutorials and posting about my updates to some open source projects.

My website is very simple, and I want to keep it that way.

I really like the look and feel of [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com), and found a WordPress theme that mimic's it. I modified the theme slightly and open sourced it on [GitHub](https://github.com/grahammccarthy/wp-svbtle).

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

I don't really have a favourite part of my website. I like that all of the pages are very much the same. My Games section has a good flow with the images nicely laid out. It's extremely simple. I also really like my "Kudos" button on the right side of each post. I really like the California Bear on it.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

Right now it is all WordPress as it has been the easiest thing to maintain. I used to be caught up in a cycle of making a brand new site every year, using whatever technologies I was interested in at the time, only to end up not writing any content. So I've decided to stick with WordPress and try to focus on creating content instead of redesigning the site.

I'm using a WP theme that mimic's Svbtle, called wp-svbtle, that i've modified slightly.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

Nothing planned, although it definitely needs an update. I would like to start adding more content regularly. However, it has been a bit tough balancing time between [SoapBox](http://soapboxhq.com), my blog and a few other websites that I maintain.
