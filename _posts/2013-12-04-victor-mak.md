**Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.**

My name is Victor Mak, a full-stack web developer with heavy focus on UI/UX design. I’m a 4th year student at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) and currently work as a software engineer for [SoapBox](http://soapboxhq.com), an innovation management tool based in Toronto. I like to think of myself as a true generalist with interest in various areas of web development, from making things look pretty on the front-end to dealing with databases and servers on the back-end.

I love working on random side projects and interacting with talented people in the design and development scene, as I am able to learn and incorporate their methodologies into my everyday work. Because of this I'm a frequent user of [GitHub](http://github.com/victormakcy), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vicmakcy) and frequent viewer of various design and development blogs such as [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com), and [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com)

Aside from coding I have interest in things ranging from startups to photography ([500px](http://500px.com/victormakcy)) to finance, it’s just the generalist part about me.

**Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?**

The primary purpose of my site was to have a place for potential employers to see my side projects and get to know me better. Being in the co-op program at waterloo I would go through plenty of application and interview rounds, almost as frequent as every four months. I simply wanted a site that could help describe who I was through the web and get some bonus points for having a side project ;).

Version 1.0 of the site had me playing with multiple pages, a nav bar that stuck to the left and my poor attempt at a responsive design. It was my first stab at creating a website and looking back, it wasn’t as bad as I thought. 

Version 2.0 is what I would call the current site, be-it there has been plenty of revisions since the initial update. This time I wanted a much more minimalistic design, and honestly, what’s more minimalistic than a solid colour background, simple typeface and a few text. The colour-scheme is based on one of my favourite colours (blue), which naturally compliments many colour schemes.

**What part of your website is your favourite, and why?**

My favourite part of the site would probably have to be the jQuery animations. The initial fade-in and the showing of my projects may seem simple in terms of code, but the site benefits greatly from the effects and does not take away the simplistic feel I wanted.


**Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?**

Just JQuery for the JavaScript effects. I don’t like including libraries such as Bootstrap for a simple project like this where I don’t really have other assets such as buttons or a nav. I might decide to include Bootstrap in the future for its grid system, but for now I’m happy as it is.

**Any upcoming changes we should look out for?**

The biggest change I want is to make a more responsive site, one suitable for phone and tablet viewing. Also I might change the JQuery animations into CSS animations and go with a JavaScript-less design.

Apart from those I’m really not sure where I want to take it next, maybe I’ll try for a multipage site again, maybe I’ll add some pictures of cats, or maybe I’ll just CMD+A -> delete and call it a day.
