## Let's get to know you first. Tell us about yourself.

My name is Conrad, and I am an iOS developer, occasional blogger, and high school student. I am interested in all kinds of topics, from hackathons and programming education to privacy and cryptography. When I'm not programming, I can usually be found playing soccer.

I am currently working on [DeskConnect](http://deskconnect.com).

## Cool, so what's the story behind your website and its design?

This past summer, while I was interning at Airbnb, I realized that I needed a new website. I didn't have a good personal website at the time and my blog on Tumblr was looking outdated. So in my free time I bought a short domain and designed a flat and responsive site to display my blog posts and give a little information about myself. I'm a fan of minimalism, so that was definitely reflected in the design of the website.

## What part of your website is your favourite, and why?

I like the SVG logo in the top left that navigates back to home because of its simplicity. I am also proud of the syntax highlighting functionality on the blog. It is styled to look like Github's own syntax highlighting and is readable on mobile.

## Is there anything you wish you knew when you first started building your website?

How easy it was. I normally do native development and avoid web design like the plague, but I learned that web design is pretty easy to pick up.

## Technologies, languages, frameworks, or libraries?

I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). All of the CSS is custom, and probably poorly structured. The full source can be found [here](https://github.com/conradev/conradev.github.io). I write all of my blog posts in Markdown, which is very nice.

## Any upcoming changes we should look out for?

I am hoping to write some more blog posts in the near future. Practice makes improvement!
